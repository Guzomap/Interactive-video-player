# Interactive Video Player
[Demo Interactive Video Player Here](https://yog9.github.io/Interactive-video-player/)
### Summary
Interactive Video Player is HTML 5 video player built from scratch using HTML5 Video API , CSS , Javascript along with some SVG for the video controls.

### Motivation
The purpose of this project was to understand more about HTML5 Video API and Javascript interactivity.

### Getting Started
 Click the demo link or clone/download the repository on your local machine and open the index.html file with a browser.
 Click the transcript below the video to see how the media playback time changes or vice-versa.
 
### Thoughts
At First I thought of doing this project with the help of media.js plugin which would cut down the project time to half but I 
thought of implementing without the use of any plugin.Styling the controls at different media breakpoints was  was surprisingly very challenging.
I commited of doing this project without a library to enhance my javascript skills.

### Built With
